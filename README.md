I am Junior ASP.NET Core Developer who is also interested in learning JavaScript and React. My interest in coding started in high school. At that time, I was designing my own website and blog with CMS. This way led me to the world of technology and computers. I am currently working in the NiCode as a Back-end developer, which has allowed me to experience the following concepts:
-ASP.NET Core
-Entity framework Core
-Docker
-Web API
-C#
-SQL Server
-MVC
-Git/GitHub
-TeamWork
