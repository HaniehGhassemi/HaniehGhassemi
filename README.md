### Hi, I'm Hanieh ðŸ‘‹
I am Junior ASP.NET Core Developer who is also interested in learning JavaScript and React. My interest in coding started in high school. At that time, I was designing my own website and blog with CMS. This way led me to the world of technology and computers. I am currently working in the NiCode as a Back-end developer, which has allowed me to experience the following concepts:<br/>
-ASP.NET Core<br/>
-Entity framework Core<br/>
-Docker<br/>
-Web API<br/>
-C#<br/>
-SQL Server<br/>
-MVC<br/>
-Git/GitHub<br/>
-Team Work
